# BasicGravity

A simple C++ OpenGL project simulating a gravity-like deformation on a surface.  
This project visualizes a sphere moving across a curved grid, inspired by spacetime curvature in general relativity.

## Features

- OpenGL-based rendering
- 3D sphere and grid surface
- Gravity deformation effect
- Smooth motion and shading
